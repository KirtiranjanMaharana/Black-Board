# Black-Board

The Black Board project is a web application built using React and Tailwind CSS that showcases the concept of an infinite canvas using HTML5 canvas. This project explores the mathematical principles behind an infinitely expanding canvas and allows users to draw, erase, pan, and zoom without predefined boundaries.

## Project Overview

The main objective of this project is to create an infinite drawing canvas within a React application. The canvas is dynamically rendered using HTML5 canvas and can expand infinitely in all directions, offering users a vast visual space to work on large-scale drawings or explore creative ideas.

### How to Use

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.

2. Install the required dependencies using npm install.

3. Run the development server using npm start.

4. Open your web browser and access the Infinite Board at the provided local URL.

5. Use the mouse to draw lines or erase elements. Right-click to erase.

6. Click and drag to pan across the canvas. Mouse wheel or pinch-to-zoom to zoom in or out.

### Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, used to create the Infinite Board application.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework, utilized for styling the user interface elements and ensuring responsiveness.
HTML5 Canvas: Provides a two-dimensional drawing surface for rendering graphics.
